 * if we don't aggregate all the keys,
 * then we can only perform the traversal of keys based on either 'reducerState' or 'stateMap',
 * and restore them based on whether they have properties confirmed by the hasOwnProperty method.
 * If we choose reducerState, we will not be able to control the newly added key,
 * and if we choose stateMap, we will not be able to delete the key.
 * Neither of them is perfect, so we must merge both sets of results.
